# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# Ideas

Straight-forward recursion algorithm. Not really much to say about this.

It is also possible to solve this problem using either BFS or DFS, but I just got lazy.
